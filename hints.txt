!!!! Replace xxx with your obtained level password !!!!

LEVEL 1	- Integer Overflow
-------
   ./exploit hello [Integer value]
   
   Hint: Signed or unsigned, that's the question

LEVEL 2	- Stack Overflow
-------
   ./exploit xxx [username] [password]

   Hint: try admin as username
   I'm sure they didn't expect a username or password to be very long :)
   Try to run the function level3password

LEVEL 3 - Array Overflow
-------
   ./exploit xxx [arraynumber] [content]

   Hint: You have a maximum of 32 slots to store content.
   Try to run the function level4password

LEVEL 4 - Off by One
-------
   ./exploit xxx [magic]
   
   Hint: Magic happens if there are enough null bytes

LEVEL 5 - Stack Cookie
-------
   ./exploit xxx [magic]
   
   Hint: There might be a stack cookie preventing you to have success

LEVEL 6 - Format String
-------
   ./exploit xxx
   
   Hint: r should return Y instead of N. But sometimes codes don't want you to reach a simple 'Y'.  
         But maybe a print function is buggy ?
   

LEVEL 7 - Heap Overflow
-------
   [32-Bit] 
   ./exploit xxx [text]

   Hint: Success will be for those to change the magic to 0x6763

LEVEL 8 - Type Confusion
------- 
   ./exploit xxx [cmd]
   
   Hint: How can we set the pointer of g to be the pointer of b, in order to get a pointer that is executed ?

LEVEL 9 - Zero Pointers
-------
   ./exploit xxx [addr] [flag1] [flag2]
   
   Hint: Try some address with flag1=0 and flag2=0
   

LEVEL 10 - Command Injection
--------
   ./exploit xxx [Cmd]
   
   Hint: This will run "man Cmd". How can we run our own command, maybe a ; is helpful ?

LEVEL 11 - Path Traversal
--------
   ./exploit xxx [Directory]
   
   Hint: Only ./dir1/dir2/ may be accepted, but maybe there is a trick to access a lower directory ?


LEVEL 12 - Return Oriented Programming (ROP)
--------
   ./exploit xxx
   
   Hint: How can we change the flag 1234 to 5678 using some string ?
   The compare at 0x01145c (32bit) / 0x0x400784 (64bit) needs some love

LEVEL 13 - Use after Free
--------
    ./exploit xxx [options]

    Hint: Maybe a destroyed mapping can be reused to our advantage ?


LEVEL 14 - Jump Oriented Programming (JOP)
--------
    ./exploit xxx token.bin

    Hint: Craft a token.bin that will how you to do your stuff. First integer is total length (little endian), it should bypass the compare at 0x11588 (32bit) / 0x400878 (64bit)
